This directory is meant for small applications or examples of using the library.

Right now there is a Guile script `trials.scm` which defines some bindings manually and produces a few figures. The figures are done with an unpublished library so you cannot run the script just yet â€”I will eventually clean that out (or publish the libraries).

We'll have more stuff going forward.
