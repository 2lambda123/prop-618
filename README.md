## Propagation models for Earth-space telecommuncations systems

This is after [P.618](https://www.itu.int/dms_pubrec/itu-r/rec/p/R-REC-P.618-13-201712-I!!PDF-E.pdf) and other references given there and in this [ITU table](https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-R/study-groups/rsg3/Pages/iono-tropo-spheric.aspx). It's meant to be a fairly straightforward implementation. The ones I could find were in Matlab/Octave (from ITU & national offices) or gave no source [(from CNES)](https://logiciels.cnes.fr/fr/content/propa).

## Other

This is the first anything I write in Fortran so be understanding :p  I've read that `.f95` is the customary extension for Fortran >95 code, including 2008, so the Fortran files have that extension. They are meant to be Fortran 2008.
