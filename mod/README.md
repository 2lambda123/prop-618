This directory contains bindings to use the library from C, Python, and Guile.

The C headers and the Python bindings are generated by `mod/protos.scm`. They are included here so that you don't need to be able to run the generator yourself.

For Guile there is a script `prop.scm` which defines the bindings manually and produces a few figures. The figures are done with an unpublished library so you cannot run the script just yet â€”I will eventually clean that out (or publish the libraries).
