This directory contains bindings to other languages.

The C headers are generated by `mod/protos.scm` through the build process and are included here so that you can build and use the library even if CMake isn't able to run the generator.

For Guile we have a script `prop.scm` which defines the bindings manually and produces a few figures. The figures are done with an unpublished library so you cannot run the script just yet â€”I will eventually clean that out (or publish the libraries).

Binding to other languages will be generated in the future.
